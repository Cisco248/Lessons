# üßµ Threading Using C Language

## _Cisco Sample Coding_

> A practical introduction to threading, its differences with processes, and synchronization mechanisms using the C language.

---

## üì¶ Installation Requirements

Before running any threading code in C, ensure the following are installed and configured:

### ‚úÖ Install C Compiler (MinGW-w64 via MSYS2)

> **MinGW-w64** gives you the GCC compiler with pthread support on Windows.

1. **Download MSYS2**
   Get it from [https://www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org)

2. **Install MSYS2**
   Follow the installer steps. Recommended path: `C:\msys64`

3. **Open MSYS2 terminal** and install the toolchain:

   ```sh
   pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
   ```

4. **Update Windows Environment Path**

   - Add this to the User Path variable:

   ```makefile
   C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin
   ```

5. **Verify installation**

   ```sh
   gcc --version
   g++ --version
   gdb --version
   ```

## üíª Set Up Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code from [the official Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com)

2. Install C/C++ Extension
   - Open VS Code
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Extensions)
   - Search for: C/C++
   - Install the Microsoft C/C++ extension

## üìÅ Create Your Project Folder

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```sh
mkdir projects
cd projects
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
```

Open the folder in VS Code:

```sh
code .
```

Create a new file named: `main.c`

### ‚úÖ Sample Code: Basic Thread

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    printf("Hello from the thread!\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_function, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
    printf("Hello from the main thread!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compile & Run

In the terminal (`ucrt64` or `Terminal`):

```sh
gcc main.c -o main -lpthread
./main
```

Expected Output:

```css
Hello from the thread!
Hello from the main thread!
```

## üìò Notes

- Always compile thread programs with -lpthread.
- Use gdb for debugging thread execution.
- Create separate .c files for each lesson.

## üéØ End Goal

By the end of these lessons, you should:

- Understand thread creation and synchronization
- Be aware of concurrency bugs (e.g., race conditions)
- Know how to prevent deadlocks
- Apply threading to real-world C applications
