// Your code initializes a linked list with three nodes and prints the values. However, there are some issues to address:

// insert_end function: Currently, it only creates a new node but doesn't link it to the end of the list.
// Memory allocation checks: It's a good practice to check if malloc returns NULL.
// Freeing allocated memory: Only two nodes are being freed, which may cause a memory leak if more nodes are added.
// Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code:

// Fixed insert_end function to properly insert nodes at the end of the list.
// Added malloc checks.
// Ensured all dynamically allocated memory is freed.

// In this version:

// The insert_end function properly inserts a new node at the end of the list.
// The malloc checks ensure that the program handles memory allocation failures gracefully.
// The while loop at the end of main frees all allocated nodes to prevent memory leaks.
